    <h1>Why do I have dark marks on the face</h1>
<p>There are many reasons why you may notice dark marks appearing on the face. We discussed some of the most common causes below. </p>
<p>Darkness brackets pigmentation close brackets of the skin is caused is the consequence of melanin pigment which is produced by specialised cells called melanocytes which are located between the very surface layer of skin, the epidermis, and the deeper layer of the skin is known as the dermis. Abnormalities of increased pigmentation reflect either and increased number of melanocytes, an increase in production by these melanocytes or the movement of pigment that is produced from melanocytes from the surface layer of the skin to deeper layers.</p>
<h2>Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation</h2>
<p>Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation is probably the most common cause of dark marks on the face. the appearance of dark marks on the skin following an episode of inflammation. It is much more common with individuals with pigmented skin types and there's with white skin. The causes of inflammation can range from eczema to acne to skin allergies. In some cases the preceding information is not obvious. It can be imagined in the same way that if you drop a stone into the water you get ripples would follow the initial episode and these reports represent the information.</p>
<p>The pattern of the pigmentation brackets dark marks close brackets and give a clue as to the trigger. Acne will typically leave small discreet lock box at the site of previous spots. Eczema tends to leave larger areas of pigmentation full stop</p>
<p>Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation is caused by pigment from the melanocytes falling deeper within the skin and the normal level of which is the junction of the epidermis bracket service logos brackets and dermis brackets deeper layer close brackets. This usually is a consequence of information and the pigment can be contained within inflammatory cells deeper within the dermis. Unfortunately as the pigment is deep within the skin, treatments such as creams and lasers have no effect in treating it. It will gradually improve with time, however this will take many months or even years. And in some cases may never improve completely. It is important to protect the skin from sunlight exposure with a sunblock even on non sunny days. It is possible to remove the pigment using a deep chemical peel, analogous to a chemical burn, however unfortunately this usually leads to secondary information and further hyperpigmentation which can be more troublesome than the original problem. For this reason generally the management of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation is conservative and the priority is to prevent any further information either with a topical steroid or a another dog will anti-inflammatory such as protopic brackets take for Lima Screwfix close brackets. If the cause is acne than it is essential to treat the acne to prevent the development of the dark marks even if the act itself is relatively mild.</p>
<h2>Melasma</h2>
<p>Another common cause of pigmentation on the face is melasma. this more commonly occurs in women and can be related to exposure to oestrogen hormones Eva during pregnancy or from the oral contraceptive pill. There is a fountain inherited element to it and so that the members of the same family may be affected. There is also a strong word for light exposure. This includes both ultraviolet lightcomma which can be protected against by sun cream and intense visible light which will not be blocked by sunscreen.</p>
<p>In order to prevent melasma it is important to minimise exposure to estrogens. Of course it is not possible during pregnancy, however if the exposure is a consequence of the oral contraceptive pill then it may be possible to switch your alternative method of contraception. Exposure to intense light both ultraviolet and visible should also be minimised. This would involve minimising exposure to strong sunlight. And the use of a factor 50 sunscreen.</p>
<p>Where simple measures and the avoidance of light tunnel light do not prove sufficient the next stage of treatment often consists of the use of a cream which reduces pigment production by the melanocytes. Please creams typically contain hydroquinone. In the United Kingdom a commonly prescribed preparation is pigmanorm. These period should be used under the supervision of a dermatologist. They carry the risk of over bleaching the skin which in some cases can be permanent. They may also really lead to a allergic or inflammatory reaction which can lead to cell secondary hyperpigmentation. Furthermore the long-term usage can lead to V</p>
<h2>Freckles, lentigo maligna</h2>
<p>Another cause of facial pigmentation is freckling. This is more common in fair skinned individuals and is characterized by multiple small areas of light brown pigmentation. Freckles are best prevented by protecting from ultraviolet light exposure with daily sunscreen. If they are troublesome they can be removed with a pigment laser. A rare cause of pigmentation is a lentigo maligna, witches hey khush carries a small risk of progression to skin cancer brackets malignant melanoma close brackets. This is usually usually manifest is the dark mark on the face and following assessment way dermatologyst can require a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<h2>Seborrhoeic keratoses Dermsrosis papulosis Nigra</h2>
<p>Another cause of multiple. Lesions on the face is benign skin growths Python separate keratosis and dermatosis papulosa nigra. Is can occur in patients with any skin colour, however they are generally more noticeable in individuals with darker skin types. I came scene on this picture of Samuel L Jackson. They are completely harmless and have a characteristic appearance under the damat escape. If they are symptomatic they can be treated by curettage cricket scraping, watery or laser ablation. Although there is a risk of Recurrence and there is a small risk of subsequent post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.</p>
<h2>Rare causes</h2>
<p>In addition to the common causes of hyperpigmentation that we've discussed above there are Mary causes. These include lichen planus pigmentosus. Like I'm playing this is generally and rash which manifests as itchy lumps on the skin, however in some circumstances that can cause large flat areas of inflammation which lead to significant pigmentation particularly in those with darker skin types. In some cases the rash may not be obvious and the only manifestation maybe skin darkening. Second condition known as erythema discrimination per stands brackets Ashley dermatoses close brackets it lasts well characterized it's not currently clear there is a variant of lichen planus pigmentosus or an entirely separate condition. Another relatively uncommon condition which can cause significant figure hyperpigmentation is cutaneous lupus. Lupus in the skin can manifest on the face as discoid lupus or subacute lupus. Both can cause post inflammatory pigmentation this is particularly problematic for discoid lupus where it can be dis figuring. </p>
<p>Hey edition another records of facial pigmentation is ochronosis. This is most commonly caused by excessive and long-term exposure to skin whitening chemicals purchase hydroquinone. It is generally present in skin lightening creams and if used excessively can form collections beneath the skin surface which cause significant hyperpigmentation. Unfortunately in some cases patients do not realise that they are exposed to hydroquinone and continue to use the skin lightening products even when not kinesis is developing. Kenosis is excess extremely difficult to treat and I generally few effective remedies. There is an additional rare inherited form of what produces which is due to a genetic abnormality.</p>
<p>Differential diagnosis
We've discussed the most common causes of facial hyperpigmentation. It's clear that there are a large number of conditions. Whilst diagnosis can be clear in some circumstances or situations the differentiation between various conditions can be subtle and the advice of an experienced dermatologist is invaluable. This is particularly important as the treatment of different conditions is very different. In some cases a skin biopsy can be required to differentiate the various conditions.</p>
