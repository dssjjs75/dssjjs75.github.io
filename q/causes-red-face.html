    <p>Have you noticed that your face is appearing red. There are there are a number of potential causes for this and we discuss these in this article in addition to potential treatments.</p>
<h2>Facial flushing</h2>
<p>Whilst some degree of facial flushing / redness is normal particularly in response to emotional situations. In some individuals this can be a problematic and socially embarrassing problem. Facial flushing can also represent an early stage in the evolution of rosacea (see below). Options for treatment include oral antibiotics such as lymecycline, beta blockers such as propranolol and topical treatment such as Mirvaso. In selected patients other medicines such as clonidine or alpha blockers can be helpful. The treatment of resistant facial flushing can be challenging.</p>
<h2>Rosacea</h2>
<p>One of the most common causes of facial redness is rosacea. This condition can range from intermittent flushing of the face to permanent lumpy redness. It is more common in individuals of celtic (e.g. Irish, Scottish) origin and the incidence increases with age. </p>
<p>Early stages are characterized by flushing in response to particular stimuli such as spicy food or alcohol. As time goes on the flushing can become fixed and associated with lumps and even with enlargement of the nose, a condition known as rhinophyma. </p>
<p>Treatments for rosacea range from creams and ointments such as finacea gel, Metronidazole gel, soolantra (topical ivermectin) to oral treatments including antibiotics such as lymecycline and erythromycin. Where oral antibiotics are used a course of at least 3 months is typically required. If these prove ineffective then selected patients may respond to an extended course of low dose oral isotretinoin (roaccutane). Once rosacea has been controlled with medications or creams there may be an element of redness which persists as a consequence of dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia). This is known as telangiectatic rosacea. Long lasting improvement can be achieved with treatments such as intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy or pulsed dye laser, however these may be expensive. Temporary can be achieved with Mirvaso, which constricts tiny blood vessels within the skin temporarily (for approximately 8 hours).</p>
<h2>Seborrhoeic dermatitis</h2>
<p>A second common cause of facial redness is seborrheic dermatitis. This condition is characterized by redness and scaling, it particularly affects the areas adjacent to the nose and lips (nasolabial folds). It is often associated with scaling of the scalp and scaling or greasy spots affecting the upper chest. Usually it is very straightforward to differentiate seborrhoeic dermatitis from rosacea, and is important to make the distinction since seborrhoeic dermatitis is often treated with a topical a mild topical steroid rosacea is worsened by the usage of topical steroids. A good treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis is daktacort, a combination of a mild topical steroid and an anti yeast medicine. This can be used intermittently as required. Other good treatment options include topical tacrolimus (protopic).</p>
<h2>Facial eczema</h2>
<p>Another cause of scaling, itching and redness on the face is facial eczema. Facial eczema is also often associated with eczema elsewhere on the body but can be present on its own. It is also more common in individuals who have conditions such as hayfever and asthma and for whom family members have these conditions. Facial eczema is treated initially with topical steroids of mild potency such as eumovate. Other options include topical tacrolimus (protopic), which has the advantage of not causing thinning of the skin. For severe facial eczema which does not respond to these measures in some in a small number of patients oral immunosuppressive medications are required.</p>
<h2>Allergic contact dermatitis</h2>
<p>A related condition to facial eczema is allergic contact dermatitis. Is can look identical to facial eczema with dryness itching and scaling, however it is caused by an allergic reaction to a substance coming into direct contact with the skin. Common sites include around the eyes but it can affect any area on the face. There is a significant delay between exposure and the emergence of the rash and the appearance of the rash on the face and therefore in many cases the causative role of the allergen is not recognized. </p>
<p>Allergies to substances such as nail varnish and acrylic nails can cause inflammation and itchiness around the eyes as these areas are commonly touched. Dryness and itching of these areas can also be caused by contact lens solution. In some circumstances the allergen can be carried in the air. Other common causes of facial allergic contact dermatitis are preservatives and fragrances in personal care products. It requires a high index of suspicion to make this sinuses and it is confirmed by patch testing that tests for allergies by applying multiple test patches to the back.</p>
<h2>Psoriasis</h2>
<p>Psoriasis on the face can be associated with psoriasis elsewhere on the body. Commmon areas of involvement include the scalp, hairline and ears. Sebopsoriasis is a variant that commonly affects areas such as the eyebrows and nasolabial folds and can overlap with seborrhoiec dermatitis. This can be treated with mild topical steroids such as hydrocortisone or eumovate. A particularly helpful treatment is topical tacrolimus (protopic) which does not cause skin thinning. Other psoriasis treatments such as diprosalic and dovobet are generally too harsh for facial skin.</p>
<h2>Rare causes</h2>
<p>The causes listed above are the most commonly encountered causes of facial redness. However there are a large number of causes which are occasionally encountered. These range from conditions such as lupus in the skin to sun sunburn and photosensitivity.</p>
<h2>Differential diagnosis and role of dermatologist</h2>
<p>Is important to make the correct diagnosis of the treatment of these different causes of facial redness can vary dramatically. For example topical steroids an effective treatment for facial eczema they are known to worsen rosacea. Similarly if the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis it is critical that the relevant allergen is identified. In many cases diagnosis is relatively straightforward however in other cases it can be subtle requiring assessment by an experienced dermatologist. </p>
