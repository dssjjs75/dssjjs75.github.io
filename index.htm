    <h2>7 Possible Reasons for a Red Face</h2>
<p><img alt="Red Face" src="./img/the-realities-of-redness/red-face.jpg" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>
<p>Red in the face? It might be more than a rush of emotions. Redness of the face can actually be indicative of a number of different skin conditions. So if that flushed complexion has been around for a while, it is time you look into the different skin conditions that may cause it.</p>
<p>Find out the seven most common reasons for red face and determine whether you need to visit your dermatologist by reading through this comprehensive list.</p>
<h2>7 of the Most Common Reasons for Face Redness</h2>
<h3>1. Facial Flushing</h3>
<p><img alt="Red Face" src="./img/the-realities-of-redness/facial-flushing.jpg" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>
<p>it is normal for us to get red in the face as a result of strong emotions. Things like embarrassment and anger can instantly cause a flushing of the face.
This is absolutely normal, and the redness often fades away as soon as the emotion subsides. In some cases however, individuals can develop resistant facial flushing which takes more time to fade. If resistant facial flushing persists, it could be indicative of the start of rosacea.
While it’s possible to treat facial flushing, the treatment process can be complicated. Some of the options dermatologists might offer include antibiotics such as lymecycline, beta blockers such as propanolol, and topical treatments like Mirvaso.</p>
<h3>2. Rosacea</h3>
<p><img alt="Red Face" src="./img/the-realities-of-redness/rosacea.jpg" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>
<p>When facial flushing becomes resistant, it develops into rosacea. This skin condition starts out as a flushing response to certain stimuli like consuming alcohol or spicy food. Those most prone to developing rosacea are older individuals and those of Celtic decent.
During the later stages, rosacea can become a permanent redness riddled with lumps and blemishes. In some cases, individuals may even experience rhinophyma characterized by the enlargement of the nose.
While rosacea is anything but life threatening, it can deal a crippling blow to your confidence. Fortunately, treatments for this problem are widespread. Topical creams and gels such as metronidazole and soolantra are the most common, least invasive treatment options.
For more advanced cases, oral antibiotics like lymecycline an erythromycin are the most prescribed treatments. These need to be used for at least 3 months to guarantee that the condition is properly and sufficiently addressed.
Finally, individuals with severe cases of rosacea may be given oral isotretinoin as treatment. This usually is enough to control the symptoms, especially pain, discomfort, and burning sensations.
Once the rosacea is properly controlled, individuals can seek other treatments to reduce redness. Intense pulsed light therapy or pulsed dye laser are effective, however expensive remedies to even out skin tone. Temporary redness reduction can also be relieved with Mirvaso which works up to 8 hours per dosage</p>
<h3>3. Seborrheic Dermatitis</h3>
<p><img alt="Red Face" src="./img/the-realities-of-redness/facial-seb-derm.jpg" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>
<p>Characterized by redness, scaling, flaking, and itching, this skin condition is another likely reason for a red face. While it can happen anywhere on the skin, it most commonly develops around the folds of the nose and lips.
It is important to make sure seborrheic dermatitis is properly diagnosed because the treatments used for this skin condition can aggravate others. Fortunately, diagnosing seborrheic dermatitis can be easy especially with the help of a dermatologist.
Topical steroids like daktacort are the first treatments of choice for this skin condition, but some doctors may also prescribe topical tacrolimus in some cases.</p>
<h3>4. Facial Eczema</h3>
<p><img alt="Red Face" src="./img/the-realities-of-redness/facial-eczema.jpg" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>
<p>This is characterized by itching, scaling, and redness which can occur anywhere on the body. Often, facial eczema develops alongside eczema on other parts of the body, but it can develop independently.
Topical steroids of mild potency such as eumovate are great treatments for earlier stages of facial eczema. As the condition worsens however, doctors may prescribe the use of immunosuppressive medications. This is done because eczema is often associated with an overactive allergic response to certain stimuli in the environment.</p>
<h3>5. Allergic Contact Dermatitis</h3>
<p><img alt="Red Face" src="./img/the-realities-of-redness/facial-acd.jpg" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>
<p>Resembling facial eczema is allergic contact dermatitis. The main distinction between the two is that facial eczema is often caused by reactions to certain airborne allergens that cause hayfever and asthama, while contact dermatitis happens as the result of physical contact with substances in the environments.
Once the allergen makes contact with the skin of the face, the area affected will then develop itching, scaling, and redness. The difficulty with allergic contact dermatitis is that the rash doesn’t develop immediately after contact. So diagnosing it accurately can be a challenge, especially if the patient doesn’t know that they’re allergic.
It is possible to develop allergic contact dermatitis on the face if the individual accidentally scratches the face with certain substances on their hands. Things like nail polish, contact lens solutions, and even preservatives and personal care products with potent fragrances can become the reason for allergic contact dermatitis.</p>
<h3>6. Psoriasis</h3>
<p><img alt="Red Face" src="./img/the-realities-of-redness/facial-psoriasis.jpg" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>
<p>It is more common for psoriasis on the face to develop alongside psoriasis throughout the entire body. On the head, the most commonly affected areas are the scalp, behind the ears, and along the hairline. Psoriasis that affects the eyebrows and nasolabial folds is called sebopsoriasis, and can even occur alongside seborrheic dermatitis. To treat psoriasis, doctors will prescribe mild topical steroids like eumovate or hydrocortisone.Some other treatments that a dermatologist might recommend include topical tacrolimus, diprosalic, and dobovet which are reserved for more severe cases.</p>
<h3>7. Rare Cases</h3>
<p><img alt="Red Face" src="./img/the-realities-of-redness/discoid-lupus.jpg" title="Logo Title Text 1" /></p>
<p>While the six previously mentioned conditions are the most common causes of face redness, there are a handful of others that might also be a culprit. Less common reasons for a red face range from harmless sunburn and photosensitivity, to more serious health problems like lupus.</p>
<h2>Should You See a Dermatologist?</h2>
<p>Because there are so many different possible causes for a red face, seeing a dermatologist to get an accurate diagnosis is essential. This helps ensure that you use the right treatments that will sufficiently address your skin condition with as minimal risk as possible. The last thing you‚Äôd want would be to aggravate your problem because you   made a faulty decision with your self-diagnosis.
Don’t be fooled, what you see on the outside isn’t always what it seems. While that redness might seem just skin deep, there may be a serious problem just resting beneath the surface. So be sure to consult a specialist to see just what is causing that reddish-pink tinge and resolve any skin condition before it is too late.</p>
